How To Play:

2 teams with 2 players each play against each other

goal of the game is to capture 3 subboards in a row by a single team

the subboards themselves can only be claimed alone but he main board can be claimed by a combination of both players
eg: for the main board x + x in a row will grant them the win, but for the subboard only x x x or + + + will be counted as a subboard win

if your last turn was on a subboard you cannot place a symbol in the same subboard the very next turn

power ups are there and can be used by pressing the space bar and changing your place_mode to power up
left clicking on a subcell will result in using a missile while right clicking will result in using a nuke
every 15 turns the teams will recieve a missile, if used a missile will delete whatever symbol is placed in that specific subcell
every time a team wins a subboard they will recieve a nuke, if used a nuke will delete all symbols in the subboard irrespective of team

using a power up will use up the turn of the current player
