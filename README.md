How To Play:

The game consists of a tic tac toe board, each cell of this tic tac toe board has a smaller board inside it known as a sub-board, while each cell of a sub-board is
called a sub-cell.

2 teams with 2 players each play against each other
Team1: Cross and Plus
Team2: Circle and Square

Aim of the game is to claim 3 cells of the main board in a row, to claim a cell you must win the subboard within the respective cell.

the subboards themselves can only be claimed alone but the main board can be claimed by a combination of both players
eg: for the main board x + x in a row will grant them the win, but for the subboard only x x x or + + + will be counted as a subboard win

if your last turn was on a specific sub-board, you cannot place a symbol in the same sub-board the very next turn

There are two power-ups; Nukes and Missiles, and they can be used by pressing the space bar and changing your place_mode to power up
left clicking on a subcell will result in using a missile while right clicking will result in using a nuke
every 15 turns the teams will recieve a missile, if used, a missile will delete whatever symbol is placed in that specific subcell
every time a team wins a subboard they will recieve a nuke, if used, a nuke will delete all symbols in the subboard irrespective of team

using a power up will use up the turn of the current player
